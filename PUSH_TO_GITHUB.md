## 🔐 Steps to Push to GitHub

Since automated push requires authentication, follow these manual steps:

### **Method 1: Using Git Bash/Command Prompt (Recommended)**

1. **Open Git Bash** (or Command Prompt)

2. **Navigate to project:**
   ```bash
   cd /d/balilihan_waterworks/waterworks
   ```

3. **Configure Git to use credential manager (one-time setup):**
   ```bash
   git config --global credential.helper wincred
   ```

4. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **When prompted:**
   - **Username:** `JeSender` (your GitHub username)
   - **Password:** Use a **Personal Access Token** (NOT your GitHub password)

---

### **Method 2: Create Personal Access Token (If you don't have one)**

1. **Go to GitHub:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/settings/tokens

2. **Generate New Token:**
   - Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"

3. **Configure Token:**
   - **Note:** "Waterworks Deployment Token"
   - **Expiration:** Choose expiration (90 days or custom)
   - **Scopes:** Check `repo` (full control of private repositories)

4. **Generate and Copy:**
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **IMPORTANT:** Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again!)

5. **Use Token as Password:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
   - Username: `JeSender`
   - Password: `<paste your token here>`

---

### **Method 3: Using GitHub Desktop (Easiest)**

If you have GitHub Desktop installed:

1. **Open GitHub Desktop**
2. **Add repository:**
   - File → Add local repository
   - Choose: `D:\balilihan_waterworks\waterworks`
3. **Push:**
   - Click "Push origin" button at the top

---

### **Method 4: Using Visual Studio Code**

If you use VS Code:

1. **Open project in VS Code:**
   ```bash
   code /d/balilihan_waterworks/waterworks
   ```

2. **Open Source Control:**
   - Click Source Control icon (left sidebar)
   - Or press `Ctrl + Shift + G`

3. **Push:**
   - Click the three dots `...` → Push
   - Authenticate if prompted

---

## 🎯 Quick Command (Copy-Paste)

Open **Git Bash** and run:

```bash
cd /d/balilihan_waterworks/waterworks && git push origin main
```

When prompted:
- **Username:** JeSender
- **Password:** [Your Personal Access Token]

---

## ✅ Verify Push Succeeded

After pushing, verify with:

```bash
git status
```

Should say: **"Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'"**

Or check online:
- Visit: https://github.com/JeSender/waterworks/commits/main
- Your commit should appear at the top

## 🚂 Railway Auto-Deployment

Once pushed to GitHub:

1. **Railway detects the push** (within seconds)
2. **Automatically starts building**
3. **Deploys new version** (2-3 minutes)
4. **Changes go live** at: https://web-production-9445b.up.railway.app/

### **Check Railway Status:**

1. Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Find your project
3. Check "Deployments" tab
4. Look for "Building..." or "Success"

---

## 🔍 Test Your Changes

After Railway finishes deploying:

1. Visit: https://web-production-9445b.up.railway.app/
2. Login with your credentials
3. Check the sidebar - username should be on separate line!
4. No more overlap with Logout button

---

## ⚡ Alternative: Push via SSH (Advanced)

If you have SSH keys set up:

```bash
# Change remote to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:JeSender/waterworks.git

# Push
git push origin main
```

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **"Authentication failed"**
→ You're using your GitHub password. Use Personal Access Token instead!

### **"Repository not found"**
→ Check if you're logged in as the correct GitHub user

### **"Permission denied"**
→ Your token might not have `repo` scope. Create new token with correct permissions.

### **Still stuck?**
→ Try GitHub Desktop (easiest method)

## 📋 What Will Be Pushed

You have **2 commits** ready to push:

1. **Commit 1:** Role-based access control improvements
2. **Commit 2:** Fix sidebar UI overlap issue (today's fix)

Both will be pushed together when you run `git push origin main`.

---

## 💡 After First Successful Push

Git will remember your credentials (with credential manager), so future pushes will be easier:

```bash
git push
```

That's it! No username/password needed next time.
