# APPENDIX D
# User's Guide

This guide provides detailed steps to setup and deploy the Balilihan Waterworks Management System, developed using Python programming language, Django framework, and PostgreSQL database.

**Live Production System**: https://waterworks-sos3.onrender.com

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

- **Source Code**: The complete project files for the Balilihan Waterworks Management System.
- **Technical Knowledge**: Basic familiarity with Python, command-line interfaces (CMD/Terminal), and Django is recommended.
- **Internet Connection**: Required to download Python packages and dependencies.

---

## 2. System Requirements

### 2.1 Hardware Requirements

- **Processor**: Intel Core i3 / AMD Ryzen 3 or higher.
- **RAM**: 4GB or more (8GB recommended).
- **Storage**: 120GB HDD / SSD or larger (SSD recommended for faster performance).

### 2.2 Software Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11, MacOS, or Linux.
- **Language Runtime**: Python Version 3.8 or higher.
- **Package Manager**: pip (usually installed automatically with Python).
- **Web Browser**: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.
- **Database**: SQLite3 (Default) or PostgreSQL (Production).

---

## 3. Setting Up the Environment

### 3.1 Install Python

1. Download the latest version of Python from the official website:
   https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Run the installer. **Important**: Ensure you check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" before clicking "Install Now."

3. Verify installation by opening a command prompt (CMD) and typing:
   ```
   python --version
   ```

### 3.2 Install Virtual Environment Tool (Optional but Recommended)

It is best practice to run Django projects inside a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

1. Open your command prompt or terminal.

2. Install the virtual environment package:
   ```
   pip install virtualenv
   ```

---

## 4. Deploying the Application

### 4.1 Extract the Source Code

1. Download the source code (ZIP file) or clone it from the repository.

2. Extract the folder to your desired location (e.g., C:\Users\YourName\Documents\waterworks).

### 4.2 Setup Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd path/to/waterworks
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **Windows**: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - **Mac/Linux**: `source venv/bin/activate`

5. Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### 4.3 Setup the Environment File

1. Duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`

2. If no example exists, create a new file named `.env` and add your secret configurations (e.g., SECRET_KEY, DEBUG=True).

---

## 5. Configuring the Database

### 5.1 Run Migrations

Since the system currently uses SQLite3 for development, you do not need to create a database manually; Django will create the file for you.

1. In your terminal (with the virtual environment active), run the following command to set up the database tables:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

### 5.2 Create an Administrator Account

To access the admin panel, you need a superuser account.

1. Run the command:
   ```
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

2. Enter a username, email, and password when prompted.

---

## 6. Running the Application

### 6.1 Start the Development Server

1. Ensure you are still in the project directory with your virtual environment activated.

2. Run the Django development server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### 6.2 Access the System

1. Open your web browser.

2. Navigate to the following URL:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/
   ```

3. To access the admin panel, navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
   ```

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

### 7.1 Common Issues

**• Python is not recognized as an internal or external command**

**Solution:**
- You likely forgot to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation. Reinstall Python and ensure that box is checked, or manually add Python to your system variables.

**• ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'django'**

**Solution:**
- The dependencies are not installed. Ensure your virtual environment is activated (you should see (venv) in your terminal prompt) and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again.

**• OperationalError: no such table**

**Solution:**
- The database migrations have not been applied. Run `python manage.py migrate` to fix this.

**• Port already in use**

**Solution:**
- Another instance of the server is running. Close other terminal windows or run the server on a different port using:
  ```
  python manage.py runserver 8081
  ```

## 8. Advanced Setup: Switching to PostgreSQL (Production)

While the system comes pre-configured with SQLite3 for ease of testing, a production environment requires a more robust database like PostgreSQL. Follow these steps to switch databases.

### 8.1 Install PostgreSQL

1. Download and install PostgreSQL from https://www.postgresql.org/download/

2. During installation, remember the superuser password you set; you will need this later.

3. Install pgAdmin (usually included in the installer) to manage your database visually.

### 8.2 Install Python Database Adapter

Django requires a specific driver to communicate with PostgreSQL.

1. Open your terminal with the virtual environment activated.

2. Install the psycopg2 binary package:
   ```
   pip install psycopg2-binary
   ```

### 8.3 Create the Database

1. Open pgAdmin.

2. Right-click on Databases > Create > Database.

3. Name the database (e.g., `balilihan_waterworks`) and click Save.

### 8.4 Update Configuration

1. Open the `.env` file in your project directory.

2. Update the DATABASE_URL or specific database variables to match your PostgreSQL credentials. If your project uses individual variables, they should look like this:
   ```
   DB_ENGINE=django.db.backends.postgresql
   DB_NAME=balilihan_waterworks
   DB_USER=postgres
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password_here
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   ```

### 8.5 Apply Migrations to New Database

Since this is a fresh database, you must recreate the tables.

1. In the terminal, run:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. Create a new superuser for this production database:
   ```
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
